Another day another lab, this is going to be the last linux VM for a while, I'll do more of them at some point but for now I'll have to study for CCNA and after that I'd like to take a look at some windows machines. On todays menu is a vulnhub box called LazySysAdmin, it can be found [here](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/lazysysadmin-1,205/)

## Nmap recon

As always we start off with doing some basic nmap recon, first we start off with
`nmap -sP`
The output of this command let me know that the target ip is 10.0.2.12, please not, this can be different for you.

Next is to check what is running on that machine, we do it using `nmap -p- 10.0.2.12`

```

22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
3306/tcp open  mysql
6667/tcp open  irc

```

```

I see wordpress and phpmyadmin, it's also worth checking out robots.txt
Since we have no valid credentials yet, we should probably focus on wordpress first.

## wordpress

http://10.0.2.12/wordpress/wp-login.php is the url to go to the wordpress login page, the first thing you should try is type in username a password a to see the error message.
this gave me an invalid username message, which is great, because this means that we can bruteforce the username if it's necessary.

let's first run wpscan

this gave us some nice exploits..


```

I've tried bruteforcing with some wordlists, but was not able to crack the admin password, so It's time to go back and see what other services are running on the machine..

## Samba

We see that there is a Samba Ubuntu running so we can try to connect to it with `smbclient -L 10.0.2.12`
this will prompt us for a password, we don't know this password so just press enter (so you use anonymous mode), and you'll see the following output:

```

root@clueless:~# smbclient -L 10.0.2.12
WARNING: The "syslog" option is deprecated
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password:

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
	share$          Disk      Sumshare
	IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (Web server)
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.

	Workgroup            Master
	---------            -------
	WORKGROUP            LAZYSYSADMIN


```

two options now, use CLI or GUI, I recommend GUI, open your explorer and go to "other locations" type in the following server address: `smb://10.0.2.12` and you can browse freely


alternatively, using CLI

`smbclient //LAZYSYSADMIN/share$`

Will grant you access to an smb shell in the share folder

`get ` will download files from the samba server into your home dir.

I used the GUI approach.

in the samba share you will find a document called "deets.txt"

when you open it it will contain this:

```


CBF Remembering all these passwords.

Remember to remove this file and update your password after we push out the server.

Password 12345


```

in the"wp-config.php" file there was the following interesting line
`DB_PASSWORD,TogieMYSQL12345^^'`
------


## Root

I tried to SSH `ssh togie@10.0.2.12`
togie because on wordpress he has a post saying my name is togie, and in the password of the wpdb there is also Togie in there  and used the password 12345
it worked.

`sudo -l` showed me that togie can run all commands

so all we have to do is `sudo -i` and we are Root
